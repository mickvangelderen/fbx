The `fbx` crate allows you to read FBX files.
The FBX file format specification is owned by Autodesk and closed source.
This parser is largely based on the information from [a blog post on blender.org](https://code.blender.org/2013/08/fbx-binary-file-format-specification/).

This crate should handle FBX versions 7100 to 7500. Feel free to open up an issue if you are missing a feature or find a problem with the current implementation.
